LXDE applet - Brightness control

At first, "./configure -> make -> make install" hasn't work fine yet so you need to install manually :( I'll fix it.
Anyway, it requires lxpanel and libXrandr. If you use Fedora you need to install libXrandr-devel and lxpanel-devel, and intltool packages. Also it is nice to install development packages by group install.
You can install development packages by following command.
 sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"

Build tested on Fedora 22. 

1. Build
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make DESTDIR=/path/to/temporary install
 
2. Install
 Check where lxpanel applets and icons are installed. For example, Fedora(x86_64) installs plugins are in /usr/lib64/lxpanel/plugins/ and icons are in /usr/share/lxpanel/images/ 
 Then copy files 
 # cp /path/to/temporary/usr/usr/lib/lxpanel/plugins/backlight.so /usr/lib64/lxpanel/plugins/.
 # cp /path/to/source code directroy/data/bklight.png /usr/share/lxpanel/images/.
 
3. Add applet
 Add "Backlight Control" to your lxde panel
